# Basic-Geometry
This assignment is on object oriented programming. You will be developing two classes that are fundamental in Geometry - Point and Line. In main() you will test the various functions that you have written for the classes.

Here is the skeleton of the code that you will be writing. You will have to write the bodies of all the functions that I have listed. You can always add more functions. For all floating point comparisons you must use a tolerance of 1.0e-6.
